# BitcoinStats
BitcoinStats is an open-source project which aims to develop a NodeJS library for bitcoin exchanges APIs.
# About the Project
To achive the goal of this project it will be necessary to build a developer community interested in keeping this library updated. Once a large number of exchanges are implemented, it shouldn't be rare that some of those exchanges goes offline or change the API. For start, we'll took the following assumptions:
## Language, Test Units and IDE
* The library will be develop in NodeJS;
* Test Units will be develop in TypeScript;
* Visual Studio will be the IDE of this project.

## About Bitcoin Exchanges
